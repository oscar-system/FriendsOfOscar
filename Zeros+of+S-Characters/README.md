# Zeros of S-Characters

This is the software companion of an [article with the same name](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16785) by
[Thomas Breuer](https://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Thomas.Breuer/),
[Michael Joswig](https://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~joswig/) and
[Gunter Malle](https://math.rptu.de/en/wgs/agag/people/head/malle).

## Contents:

* OSCAR code for the computation of S-characters,
* a [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/oscar-system/S_characters.jl/tree/master/ipynb/Examples.ipynb) that shows how to use the code,
* lists of non-trivial S-characters per group,
  stored as [MaRDI files](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-64529-7_25).

The repository can be found at https://github.com/oscar-system/S_characters.jl.

Current code version checked with OSCAR version 1.3.0.
